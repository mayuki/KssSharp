This file is used for generic comment parsing across CSS, SCSS, SASS & LESS.

There's single-line comment styles:

// This comment block has comment identifiers on every line.
//
// Fun fact: this is Kyle's favorite comment syntax!


There's block comment styles:

/* This comment block is a block-style comment syntax.

There's only two identifier across multiple lines. */

/* This is another common multi-line comment style.
 *
 * It has stars at the begining of every line.
 */


Some people do crazy things like mix comment styles:

// This comment has a /* comment */ identifier inside of it!

/* Look at my //cool// comment art! */


Indented comments:

    // Indented single-line comment.

    /* Indented block comment. */
